# AuthBot

A rudimentary Discord bot designed to authenticate users by email.

## Why?

Discord links can be shared and used by several people meaning that people not in one's organisation could
potentially join posing several complications. A solution would be to send an invite or approve users by
hand which is far too laborious when user numbers are high.
